        ### Multi-Objective Optimization of GFlowNet  
        **Tongji University**  
        *Feb 2025 â€“ Dec 2025*  
        - Extended the original GFlowNet framework from single-objective to multi-objective optimization, integrating reward, cost, and diversity objectives  
        - Designed a new objective formulation with additional evaluation metrics, applying concepts from evolutionary game theory to model trade-offs and dynamic policy updates  
        - Implemented and validated the extended model on molecular datasets, demonstrating improved sample cost and reward performance over the baseline

        ### Multi-Agent Spatio-temporal Coordination (Research Assistant)  
        **Tongji University**  
        *Feb 2025 â€“ Dec 2025*  
        - Conducted research on multi-agent spatiotemporal coordination in embodied intelligence, with focus on collaborative perception, task planning, and motion synchronization  
        - Explored strategies for communication and policy learning among agents to enable robust cooperation for perception and prediction  
        - Enhanced the generalization capability of embodied agents across diverse domestic scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving)
